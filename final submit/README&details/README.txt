Hello !!!!!

The question i solved is Quora similar question pairs

you can get the test and train data for this question from kaggle and paste it in "input" folder to run the code 

I did not run some blocks of the code .Because before final submission i tried to run all the code once but it was taking too long
so i planned to use the data i have sored when i last ran the code which consists of all the features. Thats why i didn't ran some of the cells
in jupyter notebook .

I have tried to explain every thing in notebook .



I am really happy to participate in hackathon because .Knowledge i gained this week will generally will take one month of regular days :-).
